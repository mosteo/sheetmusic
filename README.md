## Public domain free music scores

This repository contains my transcriptions of music I have needed at some point. Thanks to the [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) and [Musescore](https://musescore.org/) projects, any enthusiast can nowadays create, for free, beautiful scores that can be shared and tweaked by future users. Heartfelt thanks to the contributors of these and [Frescobaldi](http://frescobaldi.org/) projects.

I tend to use Lilypond for final scores that I want to look beautiful, and Musescore when I need faster experimentation and feedback (mostly when doing keyboard reductions). Not that Musescore can't produce beautiful results too with minimal pain.

Enjoy! Visit the repository (above button) to access the sources or PDFs.
